*********** Logistic-Regression-ML ************



here we have three parts:

1. data file   (LR-1 for model making) and (LR-2 just another data for testing).
2. flaskapp.py is our app that we deploying.
3. model.py: here we have trained our data using Logistic Regression.
4. model.pkl is the pickle file of our model which we can be used next.
5. index.html and predict.html for user input and output.


Objective:
    With the help of Logistic Regression we can determine 
    whether a person can admit or not by given gre, gpa & rank.
